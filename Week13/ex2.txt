Prevention
When a stalemate develops, the operating system should terminate certain processes in order to resume normal operation.
When the system should not halt by any means and resuming the process is not a huge concern, deadlock prevention is beneficial. 

Recovery
The recovery method provides many options for dealing with the already-occurring impasse.
In terms of cruelty, the methods differ.
This technique is the simplest to execute (no additional effort is necessary to terminate one process), 
but it is also the most risky and unstable. 

Avoidence
Avoidance is the better option. It is easier to implement than preventive, but it is slower in terms of performance.
The strategy's central premise is to foresee deadlocks and control resources to avoid them.
Because this forecast consumes computer resources, this technique is slower.
